# Airbnb Clone

## Introduction

This project allowed me to explore a variety of libraries and techniques in the React Native ecosystem while building a functional and visually appealing application. In this clone, you'll find user authentication, smooth animations, a parallax effect, and the ability to interact with a map and display clusters of locations. It was a fun and challenging project, packed with learning opportunities. You can sign in with Apple or Google, display a bottom sheet for actions, and more.

## Tools Used

- **Expo**: A platform for making universal React Native apps.
- **Clerk**: Authentication service for managing user accounts.
- **Reanimated**: A library for handling animations in React Native.
- **Map and Cluster**: Interactive map display with location clustering.
- **Bottom Sheet**: Modal component for enhanced user interaction.
- **Parallax Effect**: Smooth, eye-catching scrolling animation.
- **React Native**: A framework for building native apps using React.
- **Typescript**: A typed superset of JavaScript.
